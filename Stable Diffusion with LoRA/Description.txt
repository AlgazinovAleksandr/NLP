The goal of this mini project is to test the fine-tuning methods in Text2Image models. 
Fine-tuning is an important technique in NLP and related Machine Learning areas, allowing us to adapt the power of large models to perform well on specific tasks, 
rather than creating new models from scratch for these purposes. This approach both saves time and makes the results more accurate and according to our expectations. 
I decided to try to use the fine-tuning methods for image generation based on the textual prompt. 
As a result, we will be able to generate images aligning with a particular style. 
For doing this, we will use the following source: https://huggingface.co/blog/lora  (LoRA for Stable Diffusion).

Note that all the images were generated only for educational purposes using the open-source model!
