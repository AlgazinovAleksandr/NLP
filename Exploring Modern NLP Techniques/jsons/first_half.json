        "There were 800 x 20/100 = <<800*20/100=160>>160 parents who agreed to the tuition fee increase.\nSo, there were 800 - 160 = <<800-160=640>>640 parents who disagreed.",
        "New York is two-thirds as populated as all of New England, meaning there are 2/3*2100000 = <<2/3*2100000=1400000>>1400000 people living in New York.\nThe combined population of both states is 1400000+2100000 = <<1400000+2100000=3500000>>3500000",
        "We have 56 + 40 = <<56+40=96>>96 animals other than goats.\nSo, we have 200 \u2013 96 = <<200-96=104>>104 goats"
