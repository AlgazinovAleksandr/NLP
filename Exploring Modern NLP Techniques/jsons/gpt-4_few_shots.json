      "There are 40 students total, and 80% have puppies: 40 × 0.80 = <<40*0.80=32>>32. Of those 32, 25% also have parrots: 32 × 0.25 = <<32*0.25=8>>8.",
      "Jonah burns 30 calories per hour, so in 2 hours he burns 30 × 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 calories. In 5 hours he would burn 30 × 5 = <<30*5=150>>150 calories. The extra calories lost are 150 − 60 = <<150-60=90>>90.",
      "Mark reads 2 hours per day for 7 days: 2 × 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 hours per week. He increases this by 4 hours, giving 14 + 4 = <<14+4=18>>18 hours."
