- Train PyTorch Word2Vec model from scratch on a subset of Wikipedia data
- Explore, how leveraging external word knowledge sources can help to improve the model
- Use several techniques to evaluate the quality of the model embeddings (correlation with the human-annotated data, checking the most similar words to the given word, embedding visualization)
- Compare our model with the pre-trained LLM from HuggingFace
- Discuss the advantages and the limitations of both methods
